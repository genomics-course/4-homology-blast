    "\n",
    "BLAST is an algorithm and command line program for comparing sequences and computing a similarity score. It is not, however, the name of a sequence database. In fact, you can perform BLAST on many different sequence databases, or even create your own database to search with blast. This is often a point of confusion when first learning about BLAST. \n",
    "\n",
    "NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) is a U.S. institution that hosts genomic data and tools. It is the home of an online BLAST server that we just used, as well as the Entrez database, which is an enormous relational database for storing metadata information about sequence data that has been made publicly available. The Entrez system includes tools for querying sequences according to unique identifier (GI codes); sequence names; sequences (using BLAST); or by taxonomy (Entrez hosts a complex and continually updated taxonomy).

    "### Reproducibility: Using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the BLAST and OrthoDB examples we ran in the last notebook my instructions had you click on buttons and enter in web forms. Using the tools this way was convenient because the results of your search were  displayed nicely in a browser at the end. But, a major short-coming of this approach is that it was not easy to keep a record of which links you clicked on, and therefore to communicate to someone else later how you did what you did, and how to repeat it. This is a major problem in genomics, and in science generally. Software with a graphical user inferface (GUI) is easy to use, but hard to repeat and share.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good solution for this is to use browser/GUI based tools for exploratory analyses to initially find results, but then after you have found the data you wish to retrieve, to follow this up by writing *code* that can be executed to repeat your analysis. This will be the goal of the section below, which describes the use of a *Application Programming Interface* (API) to interact with web-based tools using Python code."

    "\n",
    "Genomic data are stored in the Entrez database according to a complex hierarchy. We will not delve into the details of this. But the gist is that just about everything has a type of ID associated with it. There is a species-ID to identify the species used in any study; there is a sample-ID for the specific individuals included in a study; there is a run-ID for the sequence run used to generate genomic data for a study; and there are study-IDs and project-IDs that are used to store that all of these other IDs are related to each other through your research. Entrez stores all of this information, and in doing makes it possible to retrieve the data later using complex searches. For this, the Entrez database has been designed to be accessible through both online searches in a web-browser as well as by using API code. "

There is documentation on NCBI for how to use the Entrez API (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/). I don't expect you to read it. Many other online tools or programs have APIs as well. This is meant to demonstrate their utility, but I do not expect you to memorize how to access the API. It is typical that you need to read the documentation for any specific database to figure it out.\n",

If you only need the information from a BLAST search to identify the source of some genetic material then a simple web query can get the job done.

And if you are interested in a specific gene and how it is expressed and translated into a protein then you may want to find all of the alternative transcripts available for that gene. Finding the specific type of data that you want, and filtering through the other *stuff* on NCBI can be grueling, and confusing.
